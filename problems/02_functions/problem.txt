Write a function that returns the result of the product of two numbers (multiplication):

Hint:  multiplication operation is '*'.  To do 3 x 5, you should type 3 * 5 in javascript.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = function (a, b) {
    // ...
  }

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
